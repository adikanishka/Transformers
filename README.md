BERT Transformer 

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful pre-trained language model developed by Google. Built on the Transformer architecture, BERT reads text bidirectionally (both left-to-right and right-to-left), enabling deep contextual understanding of language.


Key features:

Transformer-based: Utilizes only the encoder stack of the original Transformer model.

Pre-trained + Fine-tuned: BERT is first trained on large corpora like Wikipedia, then fine-tuned on specific NLP tasks.

State-of-the-art results: Achieves top performance on tasks like sentiment analysis, question answering, and named entity recognition.
